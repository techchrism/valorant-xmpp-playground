# Valorant XMPP Playground

Web interface for sending and receiving Valorant XMPP messages in realtime

Essentially a combination of [Valorant XMPP Watcher](https://github.com/techchrism/valorant-xmpp-watcher) and [Valorant XMPP Log Viewer](https://github.com/techchrism/valorant-xmpp-log-viewer)
with a websocket connecting the two.

## Setup and Usage
Refer to the readme files in `backend` and `frontend`. Run simultaneously.
